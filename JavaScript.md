## 1. Introduction to JavaScript

### 1.1. What is JavaScript

​	JavaScript is high-level, interpreted programming language with object-oriented(O-O) capabilities.

>  interpreted programming language is execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.

JavaScript is loosely typed language, which means that variables do not need to have a type specified.

### 1.2. Versions of JavaScript

​	JavaScript has stabilized and has been standardized by the European Computer Manufacturer's Association, or ECMA. Implementations of this standard include the JavaScript 1.5 interpreter from Netscape and the Mozilla Foundation,  and JScript 5.5 interpreter from Microsoft.

> JScript is scripting language based on ECMAScript standard that is used in Microsoft's Internet Explorer. JScript is implemented as an Active Scripting engine.

​	Technically, the name "JavaScript" refers only to language implementations from Netscape and the Mozilla Foundation. In practice, however, everyone calls the language JavaScript.

### 1.3. Client-Side JavaScript

​	When JavaScript interpreter is embedded in a web browser, the result is client-side JavaScript. 

Client-side JavaScript combines the scripting ability of a JavaScript interpreter with the Document Object Model (DOM) defined by a web browser.
